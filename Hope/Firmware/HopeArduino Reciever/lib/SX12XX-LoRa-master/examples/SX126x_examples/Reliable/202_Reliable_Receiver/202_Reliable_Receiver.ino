/*******************************************************************************************************
  Program Operation - This is a simple demonstration of the receipt of a 'Reliable' packet.

  A reliable packet has 4 bytes automatically appended to the end of the buffer\array that is the data
  payload. The first two bytes appended are a 16bit 'NetworkID'. This receiver needs to have the same
  NetworkID as configured for the transmitter. The receiver program uses the NetworkID to check that
  the received packet is from a known source.  The third and fourth bytes appended are a 16 bit CRC of
  the payload. This receiver carries out its own CRC check on the received payload and can then verify
  this against the CRC appended to the packet. The receiver is thus able to check if the payload is valid.

  For a packet to be accepted by the receiver, the networkID and payload CRC appended to the packet by the
  transmitter need to match those from the receiver which gives a high level of assurance that the packet
  is valid.

  The received payload is copied on receive into the RXBUFFER array. This buffer can be set up to a maximum
  size of 251 bytes. A LoRa packet can be up to 255 bytes, but the reliable packet uses 4 bytes to hold the
  networkID and payload CRC. As an example if the the transmitted payload array is 16 bytes long, then the
  transmit function will increase the packet size by 4 to 20 to accommodate the networkID and payload CRC.
  Note that any packets arriving with a length greater than the length defined for RXBUFFER + 4 bytes will
  be rejected.

  It is possible to use the 'NetworkID' to direct the packet to specific receivers.

  Serial monitor baud rate should be set at 115200.
